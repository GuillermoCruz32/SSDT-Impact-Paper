\section{RESULTS}
To prove that the internship model works, it needed to be executed by the institution. The following will detail the success of the model at the institution after its implementation by describing how the software success was measured and interpret the data retrieved from the Product Owners.
This internship model has produced such favorable outcomes that it has been implemented consecutively for five years and nine softwares are currently in use at the institution. During earlier implementations of the model, the software development team was very* ambitious and used this model on multiple softwares per year, hence there being more than five applications over the course of five years. However, at the beginning of the third iteration of the internship model, the software development team determined that the model can executed be more efficiently and effectively if only one system is being worked on per year.

\subsection{Measuring Success}
In order to demonstrate the impact of software developed predominantly by undergraduate students has on higher educational institutions, a success criteria had to be defined. To determine the impact that the student-developed software has had on the institution several factors of software success are identified and evaluated.  There exists much research on quantifying project success. The metrics for software success were defined using DeLone and McLean’s Model for Information Software Success. (CITATION NEEDED) This model consists of six measures of success which included the following: system quality, information quality, use, user satisfaction, individual impact, and organizational impact. These measures may be used to evaluate the software systems based on factors including but not limited to, code quality, appearance, usability, relevance, and cost reduction. The software developed by the SSDT uses ideas outlined in the Agile Manifesto. A survey comprised of questions that derive from each of these six components as well as principles from the Manifesto was sent out to Product Owners of software that was built by the software development team.

DeLone's and McLean's Model for Software Success were used to model the questions within the survey, particularly, the last four measures were focused on for the survey as the first two (system quality and information quality) are two factors that the Product Owners will not have much interaction with and is more technical, so they were not included in the survey. These four factors* are user satisfaction, use, individual impact, and organizational impact.

\subsection{Participants}
Given the small size of our nonprofit institution, a limited number of staff have administrative access. Participants in this study included [INSERT NUMBER of PEOPLE HERE] institutional faculty and staff. All participants in this study were volunteers and were administered a survey pertaining only to the software that they had interacted with. The survey was only sent to those who were the primary users and/or had administrative privileges to the software. This pool of faculty members was selected, as opposed to surveying all users, because these subjects were involved in the initial phase of the software development process, which include defining the software project’s scope and the needs of the customer. [CITATION?] Each survey began with an informed consent disclaimer that detailed the nature of the survey.

The SSDT has nine systems that are currently in production. These include the Advancement Office, BCAC, BCSR, CAS, LSF, Ulmann, URCPP, and SKYZ. Each system has a specific functionality to aid our faculty and staff clientele perform their jobs and the surveys were tailored to each Product Owner so that the questions only reflected applications that they have interacted with. For example, CAS (Course Administration and Scheduling) helps the user schedule terms, manage courses, programs, divisions and therefore the survey only had questions that pertained to these tasks.

We distributed our surveys and gave our clients two weeks to submit their responses. just over 50 percent participation with eleven out of seventeen clients answering. (Has this number already factored out Advancement?)

\subsection{Evaluating the Software}
 The first measure of success is the system quality which ca be defined by the code quality and quality of the system's documentation. The code quality can be measured by its conciseness, testabilty, usability, efficiency, structure, and clarity. These components are

\subsubsection{User satisfaction}
User satisfaction takes into consideration the ease of usefulness of the software. The questions in the survey asked about the simplicity of completing a specific task pertaining to the individual software that Product Owner would have interacted with as well as how learnable the software is; the question asked them to rate this feature on a scale of one to four (four being very easy to use and very learnable, one being very difficult to use and hard to learn). The Product Owners were also asked to rate how useful the features in the software were to them on a scale of one to four (four being essential to them and one being mot useful). Last, the users were asked to rate the following statements based on the extent of their agreement with the statement on a scale of one to five (five being that they completely agreed with the statement and one being that they did not agree with the statement at all): The application makes my job better and I feel confident while using the application.

\paragraph{} The Product Owners were asked about how easy it was for them to use the primary features of the application that was built for them. The primary features of an application are the parts of the application that are critical to the application's usage. For instance the CAS (Course Administration and Scheduling) application has the following nine features represented: Course Scheduling, Room Preference Selection, Room Resolution, Course Management, User Management, Term Management, Building Management, Course Sequencing. Though all of these features are important within all of the applications that were built, these features all the user to perform their daily tasks. There are Out of the 11 users who responded to the survey, 9 users responded that Out of the 16 features within the application, total who responded to the survey nine answered that the features were ``Very easy to use'' and two answered that the features were

\subsubsection{Use}
Use of a software weighs the frequency of use, the length of time using the software, and the number of users who actually utilize the software. For this component, the users were given three statements and were asked to rate each statement based on the degree of  their concordance with the statement on a scale of one to five (five being that they completely agreed with the statement and one being that they did not agree with the statement at all.) The statements included the following: The application allows me to do my job, The application makes my job faster and last, My level of competency with software is not relevant when using the application. The survey also posed questions about how often each user engaged with the application (daily, weekly, monthly, yearly, once per semester, or never)  and how long the user interacts with the application (less than 15 minutes, between 15 and 30 minutes, between 30 minutes and an hour, between one to two hours, and over two hours per session).

\subsubsection{Individual Impact}
Individual impact is more of a qualitative measure that is based on the users' personal interactions with the software and its effects that it has had on them. Individual impact includes the user's confidence when using the software, improved personal productivity, the amount of time it takes to complete a task as compared to when the user did not have the software, as well the amount of effort that is put into using the software. For this portion of the survey, the user was asked to estimate how much time they spent completing tasks before the software was implemented and how much time it took to complete the same task when using the software. The user was also asked if the software met their needs that were defined in their initial request for software; this question asked them to declare how much they agreed with the statement on a scale of one to five (five being that they completely agree and one being that they  completely disagreed). Finally, they were asked how much of their day-to-day responsibilities and work depended on their ability to use the newly developed application.

\subsubsection{Organizational Impact}
Organizational impact evaluates the organizational goals of the institution, cost reduction, increase in the efficiency and the effectiveness of services. The improvement of the overall institution* directly correlates to the improvements in the users' day-to-day tasks. To gauge what impact the software has had on the institution as a whole, the users were asked to rate the impact, in regards to improvement, the solution that the software provided on a scale of one to four (four being significant improvement, one being no improvement at all). The users were also asked what it would cost in terms of money, stress, errors, and time if the new software was suddenly completely taken down and they had to revert back to their previous processes. This question also required the users to evaluate this on a scale of one to five (five being that it would cost them very much, one not costing them anything at all.) Last, the users were asked to estimate the value of the software in comparison to other applications used at the institution that were not built by the SSDT. They were also to evaluate this comparison on a scale of one to five (five being more valuable than the other software, one being less valuable than the other software).
