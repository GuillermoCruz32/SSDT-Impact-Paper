 Measuring Success
The objective of the study is to demonstrate the impact of software developed predominantly by undergraduate students has on higher educational institutions. To determine the impact that the student-developed software has had on the institution several factors of software success are identified and evaluated.  There exists much research on quantifying project success. For this study, the metrics for software success were defined using DeLone and McLean’s Model for Information Software Success. (CITATION NEEDED) This model consists of six measures of success which included the following: system quality, information quality, use, user satisfaction, individual impact, and organizational impact. These measures may be used to evaluate the software systems based on factors including but not limited to, code quality, appearance, usability, relevance, and cost reduction.  A survey comprised of questions that derive from each of these six components was constructed. There are seven software systems that are currently in production at the institution allowing for a multiple case study (CITATION NEEDED).

    Participants
Participants in this study included [INSERT NUMBER of PEOPLE HERE] Berea College faculty and staff. All participants in this study were volunteers and were administered a survey pertaining only to the software that they had interacted with. The survey was only sent to those who were the primary users and/or had administrative privileges to the software. This pool of faculty members was selected, as opposed to surveying all users, because these subjects were involved in the initial phase of the software development process, which is defining the software project’s scope and the needs of the customer. [CITATION?] Each survey began with an informed consent disclaimer that detailed the nature

The SSDT has eight systems that we handle. These include the Advancement Office, BCAC, BCSR, CAS, LSF, Ulmann, URCPP, and SKYZ. Each system has a specific functionality to aid our faculty and staff clientele perform their jobs. For example, CAS (Course Administration and Scheduling) helps the registrar, as well as faculty and staff, schedule terms, manage courses, programs, divisions, and much more.
We distributed our surveys and gave our clients two weeks to submit their responses. We barely got over 50 percent participation (9/17 survey responses were submitted)


%%should we have a paragraph for each system? Acronym breakdown, client, and system description??  Kat
Quantitative data (stats)
%I think we should include all possible responses for questions like "how important is it" to show what responses the clients were given to choose from
Of our 9 responses: %I started at column D in Data Analysis spreadsheet since the first three were not quantitative
How often do you use the software? daily use: 3, weekly use: 1, monthly use: 4, yearly use: 1.
Each time you use the  application, how long do you interact with it?: < 15 minutes: 1, 15-30 mins: 3, 30 mins - 1 hr: 4, 1 - 2 hrs: 1.
How much of your day-to-day responsibilities depend on your ability to use the  application? Important: 4, Essential: 5.
How much do you agree with each of the following statements?
[Using this application allows me to do my job better]: Strongly Disagree: 1, Neutral: 1,Agree: 1, Strongly Agree: 6.
[Using this application allows me to do my job faster]: Strongly Disagree: 1, Disagree: 1, Agree: 1, Strongly Agree: 6
[My level of competency with software is not relevant when using the software] Disagree: 1, Neutral: 4, Agree: 2 Strongly Agree: 2
%The next questions are system specific functionality/ease of use so we will have to represent that data in some other way...Since each system had different (sometimes 1, sometimes multiple, functionalites here (cas has a lot, BCSR has 1.)
%If system was gone, what would it cost client?
If the software were to be taken down entirely, what would it cost you in terms of:
Stress:
Time:
Errors:
Money:
%Comparison of system to other non SSDT software(moodle,banner, etc)
How would you estimate the value of the software compared to Berea College's following applications?
