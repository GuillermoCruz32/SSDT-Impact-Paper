The SSDT has eight systems that we handle. These include the Advancement Office, BCAC, BCSR, CAS, LSF, Ulmann, URCPP, and SKYZ. Each system has a specific functionality to aid our faculty and staff clientele perform their jobs. For example, CAS (Course Administration and Scheduling) helps the registrar, as well as faculty and staff, schedule terms, manage courses, programs, divisions, and much more. 
We distributed our surveys and gave our clients two weeks to submit their responses. We barely got over 50 percent participation (9/17 survey responses were submitted)


%%should we have a paragraph for each system? Acronym breakdown, client, and system description??  Kat
Quantitative data (stats)
%I think we should include all possible responses for questions like "how important is it" to show what responses the clients were given to choose from
