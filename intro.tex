[This is the gist. I'm used to writing essays and rlly short papers, so this needs to be fluffed and fluffed and fluffed some more. Each point should probably be a paragraph.-Past Kat]

As technology advances, users' needs follow suit. Higher educational institutions are forced to adapt with the times, and their processes are making the transition from paper to digital. Many expensive software programs have been developed for these purposes and are on the market. 

However, not all purchasable third-party software is suitable for a college's specific needs. An institution can spend upwards of around 4,000 dollars [I did a simple google search of school administration costs but like..is there something we can cite for this? also i cant put a dollar sign..-kat] These applications are built to meet general needs of managing higher education, such as registration, course scheduling, and plagiarism detection \cite{plagarismsoftware}. While it may be a good fit for some functionality, interfaces are likely crafted for a tech-savvy user pool, rendering it difficult to use for older staff members. [Idk this is a bold claim should probably cite it] However, there are processes that take place within an institution's administration that do not fall under the purview of third party software.

An institution's unique needs can be met by a team of students crafting software in-house. Through close communication with customers, the team can create simple, easy to use interfaces that save not only resources by rendering dated paper process unnecessary, but time and money as processes do not take as ling and human error decreases. The students are gaining valuable experience in this setting, preparing them for the workforce after graduation. Along with hard skills gained, such as specific programming languages and Computer Science concepts and practices, students also gain soft skills \cite{softskills} such as leadership, project and time management, and teamwork.

By recruiting a team of student software developers, a college can not only avoid the high cost of software and get applications that are tailored specifically to meet their needs, but also provide students with valuable experience that better prepares them for the industry.
