Higher-educational institutions, like many large businesses, must purchase software to manage their daily operations. Because of limited budgets, academic institutions often end up purchasing inadequate tools. These tools end up being difficult to use, poorly developed, or not fully-featured for the needs of the institution. In some cases, they are simply the wrong tool for the job. Worse yet, contracts lock institutions into this software for multiple years, putting a strain on the users who rely on the software. As an alternative solution, a team of student software developers, led by faculty and staff, can create custom, institution-specific software that meets the college's unique needs while providing students with valuable experience building their skills and preparing them for future software engineering careers. This paper highlights the successes of a five-year experiment employing college students as software developers creating software for an academic institution. The students are responsible for all aspects of the software life cycle, from design to continued maintenance.
