\section{Conclusion}
In conclusion, higher educational institutions, like most all large businesses, require software to manage their daily operations. Because of limited budgets, the costs to purchase some software is prohibitive, resulting in the purchase of software that is poorly developed, supported, or customizable. Worse yet, contracts lock institutions into this software for multiple years, putting a strain on the faculty, staff, and students who rely on the software that doesn't adequately support their needs. As an alternative solution, a team of student developers supported by a faculty and staff can create custom, institution-specific software that meets the college's unique needs. As an added bonus, students gain valuable work experience building their technical and soft skills, preparing them for software engineering positions after graduation. 

Detractors may indicate that trusting undergraduates with this task, even under the leadership of faculty or staff, is an unacceptable risk to the institution. However, the Student Software Development Team presented here counters that argument, proving that a program can exist without putting the institution at risk, provided a framework exists for guiding and monitoring the students and the code they create. Product owners for six of the eight existing applications developed by the SSDT have evaluated their satisfaction with the software, the individual impact of the software on their departments, and the organizational impact of the software, revealing that the software is important and valuable across multiple metrics. The applications have quickly became an integral part of the business of the institution, assisting in simplifying institutional management processes across campus.
